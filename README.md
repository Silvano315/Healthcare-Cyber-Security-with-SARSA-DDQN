## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository is the seventh project of the master's degree in AI Engineering with [Profession AI](https://profession.ai), all the credits for the requests and idea go to this team. 

DeepGuard Inc., a leading healthcare cybersecurity company, is facing an increase in the complexity and sophistication of cyber attacks. The need to protect sensitive patient information and ensure regulatory compliance is critical to maintaining customer trust and data security.

Project Benefits:
- Defense Improvement
- Vulnerability Identification
- Resource Optimization

The main goal is to implement advanced Reinforcement Learning algorithms to simulate and mitigate attack and defense scenarios within the [gym-idsgame](https://github.com/Limmen/gym-idsgame) environment, specialized in attack and defense simulations in computer networks. I need to use techniques such as:
- **SARSA Algorithm**: to address "random attack" scenarios in the gym-idsgame environment.
- **DDQN Algorithm with PyTorch**: to solve "random attack" and "maximal attack" scenarios.
